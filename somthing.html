                <section><p>Clean water is an essential element for human health, wellbeing and prosperity. Whether used
                    for drinking, cleaning, food production or industrial output, access to sufficient water resources
                    is a basic human need. Access to sufficient and safe sanitation facilities is also vital for
                    hygiene, disease prevention, and human health.</p>
                    <p>The World Health Organization highlights the contribution of poor water and sanitation access to
                        health, mortality and reduced poverty alleviation.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
                        <a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Contaminated drinking water, poor
                        sanitation facilities and open defecation contribute to the transmission of infectious diseases
                        such as&#xA0;diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio, and can also have severe impacts
                        on malnutrition. The WHO estimates that in 2015, the deaths of 361,000 children under
                        5-years-old could have been avoided by addressing water and sanitation risk factors.<a

                    <p>In this entry we present data on progress on improved water access, access to sanitation
                        facilities, and the incidence of open defecation. Freshwater &#x2014; whilst a basic human need&#xA0;&#x2014;
                        is also a finite, and in some regions, scarce resource. This entry also presents data on levels
                        of freshwater use, withdrawals by sector, and levels of freshwater scarcity/stress. Balancing
                        human needs for freshwater with sustaining long-term supplies will continue to pose an important
                        development challenge in the decades to follow.</p></section>

                        other improved drinking water sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes,
                        protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection).&quot; Note that access to
                        drinking water from an improved source does not ensure that the water is safe or adequate, as
                        these characteristics are not tested at the time of survey. But improved drinking water
                        technologies are more likely than those characterized as unimproved to provide safe drinking
                        water and to prevent contact with human excreta. See&#xA0;<a

                    <p>In 2015, most nations had improved water access in greater than 90 percent of households. This
                        marks significant progress since 1990 where most countries across Latin America, East and South
                        Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa were often well below 90 percent. Access remains lowest in
                        Sub-Saharan Africa where rates typically range from 40 to 80 percent of households.</p>

                    <p>Gaining access to improved water sources can often require infrastructural investment and

                        may expect access to be lower. Nonetheless, rural access has risen at a faster rate (based on
                        the relative increase in the share of the population) than total access, increasing by 22
                        percent since 1990.</p>

                        taken from groundwater or surface water sources (such as lakes or rivers) for use in
                        agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes.</p>
                    <p>As seen below, there is large variance in levels of water withdrawal across the world - this can
                        depend on a range of factors, including latitude, climate, and the importance of a country&apos;s
                        agricultural or industrial sector, as explored in the sections below.</p>

                        water withdrawals per capita</h4>
                    <p>To maintain sustainable levels of water resources, rates of water withdrawals must be below rates
                        of freshwater replenishment. &apos;Renewable internal freshwater flows&apos; refer to&#xA0;to
                        internal renewable resources (internal river flows and groundwater from rainfall) in the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Renewable internal flows are therefore an important indicator of water security or scarcity. If
                        rates of freshwater withdrawal begin to exceed the renewable flows, resources begin to decline.
                        The chart below shows the level of renewable internal freshwater resources per capita.</p>
                    <p>Per capita renewable resources depend on two factors: the total quantity of renewable flows, and
                        the size of the population. If renewable resources decline &#x2014; as can happen frequently in
                        countries with large annual variability in rainfall, such as monsoon seasons &#x2014; then per
                        capita renewable withdrawals will also fall. Similarly, if total renewable sources remain
                        constant, per capita levels can fall if a country&apos;s population is growing.</p>
                    <p>As we see below, per capita renewable resources are declining in many countries as a result of
                        population increases.&#xA0;</p>

                    <p>Water is an essential input to global agriculture, whether in the form of rainfed sources or
                        pumped irrigation. The visualisation below shows the total quantity of freshwater withdrawals
                        which are used in agriculture, whether in the form of food crop, livestock, biofuels, or other
                        non-food crop production. Data on agricultural water consumption is typically not reported on an
                        annual basis, and often gathered over several year increments.</p>
                    <p>In 2010 India was the world&apos;s largest agricultural water consumer at nearly 700 billion
                        m<sup>3</sup> per year. India&apos;s agricultural water consumption has been growing rapidly&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2014;

                    <p>How do agricultural freshwater withdrawals compare to industrial and domestic sources? Globally
                        we use approximately 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals for agriculture.<a id="ref-6"
                                                                                                     class="ref"

                    </p>
                    <p>However, this share varies significantly by country - as shown in the chart below which measures
                        the percentage of total freshwater withdrawals used for agriculture. Here we see large
                        variations geographically and by income level. The average agricultural water use for low-income
                        countries is 90 percent; 79 percent for middle income and only 41 percent at high incomes.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of countries across South Asia, Africa and Latin America which use more than
                        90 percent of water withdrawals for agriculture. The highest is Afghanistan at 99 percent.
                        Countries in the global north tend to use a much lower share of water for agriculture; Germany
                        and the Netherlands use less than one percent.&#xA0;</p>

                    <p>Municipal water is defined as the water we use for domestic, household purposes or public
                        services. This is typically the most &apos;visible&apos; form of water: the water we use for
                        drinking, cleaning, washing, and cooking.</p>
                    <p>Municipal water withdrawals are shown in the chart below. With the largest <a

                        highest at over 70 billion m&#xB3; per year. India, the next largest populace is the third
                        largest municipal water user. The United States, despite having a much lower population, is the
                        second largest user as a result of higher per capita water demands.</p><h4

                        relative to agricultural and industrial applications. Globally around 11 percent of withdrawals
                        are used for municipal purposes.</p>
                    <p>Municipal uses as a share of total water withdrawals across the world is shown in the chart
                        below. The majority of countries use less than 30 percent of withdrawals for domestic

                    <p>The share of municipal water in some countries across Sub-Saharan Africa can be high as a result
                        of very low demands for agricultural and industrial withdrawals. Domestic uses of water
                        withdrawals can also dominate in some countries across Europe with high rainfall, such as the
                        United Kingdom and Ireland where agricultural production is often largely rainfed and industrial
                        output is low.&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>

                        Water stress and scarcity</h3>
                    <p>As global population grows (increasing agricultural, industrial and domestic demands for water),
                        and water demand increases, water stress and the risk of water scarcity is now a common concern.
                        This is even more applicable for particular regions with lower water resources and/or larger
                        population pressures.</p>
                    <p>Water stress is defined based on the ratio of freshwater withdrawals to renewable freshwater
                        resources. Water stress does not insinuate that a country has water shortages, but does give an
                        indication of how close it maybe be to exceeding a water basin&apos;s renewable resources. If
                        water withdrawals exceed available resources (i.e. greater than 100 percent) then a country is
                        either extracting beyond the rate at which aquifers can be replenished, or has very high levels
                        of desalinisation water generation (the conversion of seawater to freshwater using osmosis
                        processes).</p><h4 id="internal-renewable-freshwater-resources-by-region"><a class="deep-link"

                        withdrawals as a share of internal resources</h4>
                    <p>The visualisation below provides a measure of levels of water stress across the world. This is
                        measured based on freshwater withdrawals as a share of internal (renewable) resources. The World
                        Resources Institute categorise water stress in the following ways: if withdrawals are less than
                        10 percent of resources then a country has low water stress; 10-20 percent is low-to-medium
                        stress; 20-40 percent medium-to-high; 40-80 percent high stress; and greater than 80 percent is
                        extremely high stress.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
                    <p>As shown, several countries across the Middle East, North Africa &amp; South Asia have extremely
                        high levels of water stress. Many, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Syria,
                        Pakistan, Libya have withdrawal rates well in excess of 100 percent &#x2014; this means they are
                        either extracting unsustainably from existing aquifer sources, or produce a large share of water
                        from desalinisation.</p>
                    <p>Most countries across South Asia are experiencing high water stress; medium-to-high across East
                        Asia, the United States and much of Southern and Eastern Europe. Water stress in Northern
                        Europe, Canada, much of Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania is typically low or
                        low-to-medium.</p>

                    <p>In 2000, the world set a target as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to half the
                        proportion of people without access to improved sanitation facilities by 2015 from 1990 levels.
                        Over this period, progress was made in increasing the share with access from 54 to 68 percent.
                        However, this fell short of the 77 percent target by 2015.<a id="ref-9" class="ref"

                    <p>Universal access to sanitation therefore remains one of the world&apos;s greatest development
                        challenges. Over the period from 1990-2015, a further 29 percent of the global population gained
                        access to sanitation. Although, as shown in the chart below, progress varied significantly by

                    <p>Over this 25-year period, the total number of people without access to improved sanitation has

                        2.39 billion. Total population has of course grown over this period, meaning the number with
                        access has increased from 2.8 billion to nearly 5 billion in 2015. This means that although the
                        total number without access has remained almost constant, the share of the population without
                        access has fallen.</p>

                    <p>Open defecation refers to the defecation in the open, such as in fields, forest, bushes, open
                        bodies of water, on beaches, in other open spaces or disposed of with solid waste. Open
                        defecation has a number of negative health and social impacts, including the spread of
                        infectious diseases, diarrhoea (especially in children), adverse health outcomes in pregnancy,
                        malnutrition, as well as increased vulnerability to violence &#x2014; particularly for women and
                        girls.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
                    <p>The charts below detail the share of people practicing open defecation from 1990 onwards, as a
                        percentage of the total population, rural and urban population. In 2015, 15 percent of the world&apos;s
                        population were still practicing open defecation, presenting a reduction of approximately half
                        since 1990. Regionally, prevalence was highest in South Asia where the average share is 36
                        percent. India in particular still has high rates, with nearly 45 percent still using open
                        defecation.</p>
                    <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, this rate was 23 percent. However, some countries in particular&#xA0;&#x2014;
                        such as Niger, Chad, South Sudan and Eritrea&#xA0;&#x2014; still have a prevalence between 60-80
                        percent.</p>
